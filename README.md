# What is this repository

* This repository is used for my different MRI projects and contains
  the following local branches:

    * `rtl_mjit_branch` is used for development of **RTL
      (register transfer language)** VM insns and MRI JIT (**MJIT** in
      brief) of the RTL insns

    * `rtl_mjit_branch_base` head is and will be the last merge
      point of branch `rtl_mjit_branch` with the upstream MRI trunk
        * If you want to compare RTL/MJIT with MRI upstream (e.g.
	  performance) you should use MRIs built from the two branches

    * `hash_tables_with_open_addressing` is branch for new MRI hash
      tables.  **This branch has been retired**

    * `hash_tables_with_open_addressing_base` head is the last merge
      point of branch `rtl_mjit_branch` with the upstream MRI trunk.
      **This branch has been retired**
